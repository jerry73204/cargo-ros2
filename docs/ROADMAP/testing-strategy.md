## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Per Component)
- Test individual functions/modules in isolation
- Mock external dependencies (filesystem, ament_index)
- Test error paths and edge cases
- Use property-based testing where applicable
- Target: >80% coverage per crate

### Integration Tests (Per Phase)
- Test component interactions
- Use real ROS packages (std_msgs, sensor_msgs, etc.)
- Test against actual ament installations
- Verify generated code compiles and links
- Test caching behavior
- Test workspace scenarios

### End-to-End Tests (Per Milestone)
- Complete workflow from empty project to running binary
- Test with real ROS distros (Docker-based)
- Performance benchmarks
- Comparison with existing tools (cargo-ament-build, rosidl_generator_rs)
- User scenario testing

### Regression Tests (Continuous)
- Test against known issues from ros2_rust
- Test with complex dependency graphs
- Test with large codebases
