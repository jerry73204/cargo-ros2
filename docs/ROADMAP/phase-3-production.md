## Phase 3: Production Features

**Goal**: Add services, actions, ament installation, performance optimizations.

**Duration**: 5 weeks

### Subphase 3.1: Services & Actions Integration (1 week) ✅

- [x] Full service support in cargo-ros2-bindgen
  - [x] Detect .srv files in packages (implemented in Phase 1)
  - [x] Generate service bindings (implemented in Phase 1)
  - [x] Handle service dependencies (implemented in Phase 1)

- [x] Full action support in cargo-ros2-bindgen
  - [x] Detect .action files in packages (implemented in Phase 1)
  - [x] Generate action bindings (implemented in Phase 1)
  - [x] Handle action dependencies (implemented in Phase 1)

- [x] Unit tests
  - [x] Test service discovery (in ament module)

**✅ COMPLETED - Already implemented in Phase 1!**

Services and actions support was implemented as part of Phase 1's rosidl-codegen and cargo-ros2-bindgen. The ament module discovers .srv and .action files, and the generator creates the corresponding Rust bindings. All tests pass.

**Verification**:
```rust
// Services and actions are discovered and generated automatically
// cargo-ros2-bindgen/src/ament.rs:52-61 - Discovers .srv and .action files
// cargo-ros2-bindgen/src/generator.rs:66-99 - Generates bindings
```

**✅ COMPLETED - 2025-11-04**

Implemented complete ament installation support for colcon compatibility:

**What Was Implemented**:
- ✅ Created `cargo-ros2/src/ament_installer.rs` (440 lines)
- ✅ `AmentInstaller` struct with complete installation logic
- ✅ Directory structure creation (lib, share, ament_index)
- ✅ Marker creation for package discovery
- ✅ Source file installation to share/rust/
- ✅ Binary installation with executable permissions
- ✅ Metadata (package.xml) installation
- ✅ Library vs binary package detection
- ✅ `cargo ros2 ament-build` command with --install-base and --release flags
- ✅ 5 unit tests

**Test Results**:
- ✅ 190 tests passing (+5 ament installer tests)
- ✅ Zero warnings, zero errors

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
```bash
cargo ros2 ament-build --install-base install/my_pkg --release
# Creates:
# - install/my_pkg/lib/my_pkg/ (binaries if present)
# - install/my_pkg/share/my_pkg/rust/ (source files)
# - install/my_pkg/share/ament_index/ (markers)
```

**Key Features**:
- Automatic detection of library-only packages
- Copies Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, and src/ directory
- Creates proper ament index markers for package discovery
- Sets executable permissions on binaries (Unix)
- Supports both library and binary packages
